# Everything curl

![curl logo](https://ec.haxx.se/curl-logo.jpg)

The cURL project's mission: to do reliable data transfers with Internet protocols. And giving away the code for free for anyone to use.

## How it started

We consider **March 20 1998** to be curl's birthday.

## What does curl do?

cURL is a project and its primary purpose and focus is to make two products:

* `curl`, the command-line tool
* `libcurl` the transfer library with a C API
