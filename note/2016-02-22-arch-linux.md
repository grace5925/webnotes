# Arch Linux

Arch Linux strives to provide the latest stable versions of most software by following a `rolling-release` model. 

## Principles

* Simplicity 
* Modernity
* Pragmatism
* User centrality
* Versatility

> Arch Linux is intened to fill the needs of those contributing to it. It is suited to anyone with a do-it-yourself attitude that's willing to spend some time reading the documentation and solving their own problems.

Arch is backed by `pacman`, a lightweight, simple and fast package manager that allows to upgrade the entire system with one command. Arch also provides the `Arch Build System`, a ports-like system to make it easy to build and install package from source. In addition, the *Arch User Repository* contains many thousands more of community-contributed `PKGBUILD` scripts for compiling installable packages from source using the `makepkg` application.

## History

`Judd Vinet`, a Canadian programmer and occasional guitarist, began developing Arch Linux in early 2001. In late 2007, Judd Vinet retired and transferred the reins over to American programmer `Aaron Griffin`, aka `Phrakture`.
