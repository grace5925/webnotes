# JSHint, 一款 JavaScript 代码质量工具

## 安装

It is common to install JSHint as a development dependency within an existing Node.js project:

```
npm install --save-dev jshint
```

## 配置

JSHint comes with a default set of warnings but it was designed to be very configurable. 

There are three main ways to configure your copy of JSHint: you can either specify the configuration file manually via the `--config` flag, use a special file `.jshintrc` or put your config into your projects `package.json` file under the `jshintConfig` property.

Configuration file is a simple JSON file that specifies which JSHint options to turn on or off. For example:

```json
{
    "undef": true,
    "unused": true,
    "globals": {
        "MY_GLOBAL": true
    }
}
```

### 内联配置

In addition to using configuration files you can configure JSHint from within your files using special comments. These comments start with a label such as `jshint` or `globals` and are followed by a comma-separated list of values. For example,

```
/* jshint undef: true, unused: true */
/* globals MY_GLOBAL */
```
