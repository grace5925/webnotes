Master software engineers have the ability to organize programs so that they can be reasonably sure that the resulting processes will perform the tasks intended. They can visualize the behavior of their systems in advance. They know how to structure programs so that unanticipated problems do not lead to catastrophic consequences, and when problems do arise, they can debug their programs. Well-designed computational systems, like well-designed automobiles or nuclear reactors, **are designed in a modular manner**, so that the parts can be constructed, replaced, and debugged separately.

Lisp was invented in the late 1950s as a formalism for reasoning about the use of certain kinds of logical expressions, called `recursion equiations`, as a model for computation. The language was conceived by John McCarthy and is based on his paper *Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine* (McCarthy 1960).

> formalism: 形式化
> recursion: 递归, recursion equation: 递归方程

If Lisp is not a mainstream language, why are we using it as the framework for our discussion of programming?

Because the language possesses unique features that make it an excellent medium for studying important programming constructs and data structures and for relating them to the linguistic features that support them. The most significant of these features is the fact that Lisp descriptions of processes, called `procedures`, can themselves be represented and manipulated as Lisp data.
