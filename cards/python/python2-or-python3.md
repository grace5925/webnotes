# Should I use Python 2 or Python 3 for my development activity?

## What are the differences?

Python 2.x is legacy, Python 3.x is the present and future of the language.

Pythonn 3.0 was released in 2008. The final 2.x version 2.7 release came out in mid-2010.

However, the broader Python ecosystem has amassed a significant amount of quality software over the years. The downside of breaking backwards compatibility in 3.x is that some of that software still doesn't work on 3.x yet.
